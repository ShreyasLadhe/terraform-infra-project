Terraform Infrastructure Project
This repository contains Terraform scripts to deploy and manage cloud infrastructure resources. The project is designed to demonstrate efficient, reusable infrastructure-as-code practices using Terraform.

Project Overview
The Terraform scripts in this repository automate the deployment and configuration of essential cloud resources, providing a foundation for scalable and secure infrastructure. Resources are provisioned with a focus on best practices and modular design to allow easy customization and management.

Features
Automated provisioning of cloud resources for streamlined setup
Modular design for flexible, reusable code across different environments
Scalability with support for adding new resources or adjusting existing configurations
Security best practices integrated into resource configurations
Prerequisites
Terraform version 1.0 or higher
Access to a cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
Required credentials and permissions to manage cloud resources

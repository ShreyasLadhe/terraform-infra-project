# Terraform Infrastructure Project

This repository contains Terraform scripts to deploy and manage cloud infrastructure resources. The project is designed to demonstrate efficient, reusable infrastructure-as-code practices using Terraform.

## Project Overview

The Terraform scripts in this repository automate the deployment and configuration of essential cloud resources, providing a foundation for scalable and secure infrastructure. Resources are provisioned with a focus on best practices and modular design to allow easy customization and management.

## Features

- **Automated provisioning** of cloud resources for streamlined setup
- **Modular design** for flexible, reusable code across different environments
- **Scalability** with support for adding new resources or adjusting existing configurations
- **Security** best practices integrated into resource configurations

## Prerequisites

- Terraform version 1.0 or higher
- Access to a cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- Required credentials and permissions to manage cloud resources

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShreyasLadhe/terraform-infra-project.git
   cd terraform-infra-project
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Review and customize variables** in `variables.tf` as needed.

4. **Plan the infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the configuration:**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Destroy the infrastructure** (when needed):
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Project Structure

- `main.tf` - Defines the main infrastructure components.
- `variables.tf` - Contains variable definitions for flexible configuration.
- `outputs.tf` - Lists the outputs for easier access to key resource information.
- `modules/` - Contains reusable modules for infrastructure components.
